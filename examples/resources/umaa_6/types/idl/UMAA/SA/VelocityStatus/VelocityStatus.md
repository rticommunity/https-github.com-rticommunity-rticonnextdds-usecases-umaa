# VelocityStatus
The purpose of this service is to report the linear velocity and rotational rate of the vehicle. The velocity state of a rigid body is defined by six parameters that represent the velocity components of a point in the body that is coincident with the origin of the fixed reference and the instantaneous angular velocity components. The reference system is defined as a fixed coordinate system that at that instant, aligns with the vehicle or system coordinate system.
