### reportLogReport (LogReportType)
This operation is used to report an entry on the bus that can be subscribed to and potentially entered into a system level log. This data is in addition to existing UMAA messages. It is a way of providing more detailed information than is normally published on the UMAA bus by the standard messaging.
