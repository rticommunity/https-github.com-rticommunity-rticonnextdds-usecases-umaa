# OrientationStatus
The purpose of this service is to report the orientation and rotational rate of the vehicle. The rotational state of a rigid body is defined by six parameters that represent the rotational components of a point in the body that is coincident with the origin of the fixed reference and the instantaneous angular orientation components. The reference system is defined as a fixed coordinate system that at that instant, aligns with the vehicle or system coordinate system.
